# DemoDApp

This is the demo for my Decentralised Web Apps talk, slides are available [here](https://phxtho.github.io/DAppsTalk)

## Instructions

### Smart Contract
To compile the smart contract you can copy the contents of HelloWorld.sol into the [remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you've compiled and deployed the contract update the contractaddress and ABI in the script.js

### Client App

Use a server of your choice I used [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server)

Run `lite-server .`

If you're using Metamask as your ethereum wallet you need to white list the "localhost" domain in Metamask
